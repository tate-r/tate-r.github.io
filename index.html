<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Technical Projects</h2>
<br>
<p>
  This web page (which I created myself via GitHub) is meant to showcase some of my more technical projects, including code (in python, mostly), robotics, 
and good, old-fashioned circuitry. I do this as a downtime activity, and have been doing so for many years; hence, there is much more to show than what I 
have displayed here. 
</p>
<p>
Side Note: as I have not used HTML for very long, this web page is not going to have very many fancy features (sorry). 
</p>
<p>
  Programming is a favorite pastime of mine because it presents a puzzle for me to solve through careful modification. I have dabbled in many different 
areas of Python programming, but here are some examples:<br> 
-- <b>"farkle.py"</b>, a graphics program which, using the "tkinter" library, emulates the popular dice game "Farkle" as a solitaire game on the screen 
(<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/farkle.html">see code</a>).<br>
-- <b>"quicksort.py"</b>, a small python program to implement the "quicksort" sorting method (<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/quicksort.html">see code</a>). <br>
-- <b>"matrix2.py"</b>, a long-term project of mine which implements linear algebra into python in a user-friendly manner (<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/matrix.html">see code</a>). Note: 
although I have been working on this piece of code on and off for years, affine matrices are not fully implemented, so please tell me if you run into an 
error.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Of course, not all of my programming have effects just on the computer screen. Using microcontrolers such as Arduino, I have built quite a few practical 
projects, some of which are listed here:<br>
-- <b>An Arduino temperature sensor</b>, which I built for my cousin so that he could accurately measure the temperature of an overclocked Raspberry Pi CPU 
(<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/thermometer_code.html">see code</a> <a href="http://tate-r.github.io/thermometer_image.html">see image</a>).<br>
-- <b>The Runt Rover</b>, a fast, zippy robot which was built from a kit. I programmed it with help from my dad based off of online motor shield code for my 
brother using an Arduino and a motor shield (<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/runt_rover_code.html">see code</a> 
<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/runt_rover_image.html">see image</a>).<br>
-- <b>The Mantis</b>, a gigantic steel robot powered by four massive 313 rpm motors. It has gone through many revisions and more than one explosion, and it 
still does not work. However, it is very close to completion in its newest (and hopefully final) revision. I will update you when it is finished (
<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/mantis_image.html">see image</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>
  I also program at the lowest level possible; circuits and wires. Although it takes persistence (there is no debugger program), I have created many 
complicated nests of wires that actually do cool stuff. Unfortunately, the only major project that I had the foresight to take a picture of (I have to take them apart to build more) was my electronic 
combination lock circuit (<a href="http://tate-r.github.io/circuit_image.html">see image</a>). This circuit turns on a light only for those who type in the correct code, ringing an alarm and shutting down if 
provided with the wrong one. I added several other fancy features to it, including a system which tells how many times (if any) the code has been entered 
incorrectly since the last login. Although I have no images, here are some of my other circuitry projects:<br>
-- An alarm system to keep the prying hands of my little brothers' friends away from fragile things.<br>
-- A circuit for April Fools Day, which blasts annoying noises at the push of a button. <br>
-- A reaction timer, which times how long it takes for a person to react to a light turning on.<br>
